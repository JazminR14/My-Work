You could have a very long conversation that you might not understand because sheis only 6 years old. My dad and mom are both amazing too. My dad is very outgoing we would go camping in the summer with the rest of my family, go fishing. Dad really likes to enjoy nature but is also a very hardworker.

		<h3 style="color:#F34E4E; text-align:center;font-family:verdana">Random Stuff!</h3>
		
		<p style= "text-align:center;font-family:frosty"> As you know already I watch anime and read manga. Manga is a style of Japanese comic books and graphic novels. You might be wondering why I like jappanese so much, well I don't know why I like it. Well anime helps me expand my imagination and I learn the jappanses culture. I get to know what they mostly eat how they dress and what they celerbrate and why. One more thing about anime it teaches you a new laguage jappanese of course. I watch anime in english sub meaning the characters talk in jappanese but it has subtitles. Other people watch it in english dub the characters are speaking in english. I don't just watch anime but I play the piano and Guitar. Right now I am teaching myself how to play the piano. But I really want to have guitar lessons. I use to have guitar lessons but I had to much work at school so I stop going to guitar class. When its nice out my family goes out to the park and play soccer. We sometimes even invite my uncle to come play with us and have a game togther, or just go to my uncles house and have dinner watch movies basiclly to hang out with them.
